- **Extensible**: Add your own components and templates.
- **Language-Agnostic:** Templates can be in your programming language of your choice
- **Do It Once, Get It Twice:** Write your components and we take care of creating the flags for you!
- **Component-Based**

Components are invoked via --flags.
Default components include (navbar, navbar-searchbar, sidebar, footer, footer-big, --background-video)

## Onboarding

To make sure everything runs smoothly and we don't have to get a super headache with git managment I would like every contributor to do a full (mock) pull request

### Steps:
- fork this repository
- create a new branch. Prefereably just call it your username. (i.e. `git checkout -b Zenahr`)
- commit an empty commit like so: `commit -m "my first pull request. Yay!" --allow-empty`
- create a pull request via github
- wait for the merge

Congrats! You're ready to work on this repo now.
